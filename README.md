## 🧠 How Workout Recommendation Works

1. **User Profile Input**

   * Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Fitness Level, Goal (Muscle Building, Fat Loss, Strength Training).

2. **BMI Calculation**

   * Formula: `BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m)^2)`
   * Categorized as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese.

3. **Workout Plan Generation**

   * Based on **fitness level + goal + BMI category**.
   * Each day is mapped to a **muscle group or rest day**.
   * AI logic selects **exercises** from `EXERCISE_DATABASE`.

4. **Macros & Nutrition**

   * **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** calculated using Mifflin-St Jeor equation.
   * **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** estimated using activity factor.
   * Calories adjusted based on goal (+500 for bulking, -500 for cutting).
   * Protein, fats, and carbs split calculated automatically.

5. **Progress Tracking**

   * Every time a workout is marked complete, progress updates.
   * Completion %, streaks, and workout logs visualized in graphs.

6. **Real-Time Camera Feedback**

   * Uses **webcam via HTML5 + JavaScript**.
   * Rotates between "good form" and "form correction" messages.
   * Exercise-specific suggestions displayed dynamically.
